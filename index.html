		<h1>Band of Programmers</h1>
		<p>
			Some time ago, I blerged out <a
			href="http://changedmy.name/2010/04/13/roving-bands-of-programmers.html">a
			thought</a> about small groups of skilled programmers joining
			together to briefly submit a flurry of work to a small open-source
			project before moving on. <b>Band of Programmers</b>, or BoP, is the
			result of a bit of thinking, a bit of discussion, and an unfortunate
			tendency to start new things when old ones must still be done.
		</p>
		<p>
			The idea is simple - each group meets for an hour or so each week.
			They eat food, discuss nerdy things, and eventually get around to
			deciding on a project for the week.
		</p>
		<p>
			As they have time, the members look through the project's issue
			tracker, mailing lists, wiki, source, whatever. If they find
			something that looks both interesting and feasible for their skills
			and time constraints, they email the rest of the group. Maybe a few
			people will work together on one thing. Maybe someone just doesn't
			find anything worth doing, or has crazy-hard midterms to study for.
			It doesn't matter. What <i>does</i> matter is that everyone
			generally does a little bit of something, and has a good time doing
			it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm thinking of starting a BoP with a focus on scripting languages -
			if a project involves Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Javascript, Lua -
			we'll consider it. Only know one or two of those? Join and you'll
			learn more. Not your speciality? Let me know what is, and I'll put
			you together with other people of like interest, whether it be
			systems-programming, graphics, functional mindbending, or a desire
			to only program in Whitespace and brainfuck.
